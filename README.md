# Requirement

- Python 3.8+

# Feature

- Specializing in dealing with tree structures
- Fully compatible with json
- Can be output as xml
- Can be output as jsonml

# Motivation

- Where are the standard structures for annotated tree structures?
- `xml` is the most common, but it would be nice to have a `json` compatible and highly readable structure.
- `jsonml` is hard to see.
- `jsonlogic` is good for operations, but not good for grammar.
